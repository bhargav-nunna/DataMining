For the dataset at

http://www.cs.unm.edu/~mueen/Teaching/CS591/Lectures/data.txt

find the number of clusters in the dataset. 
You need to project the data on some principal components and visualize the projected data to find the 
number of clusters.
The data file has 10,000 records each having 1000 features. You will deliver a code 
snippet in MATLAB and the visualization that you use to determine the number of 
clusters.
