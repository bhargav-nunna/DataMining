a) Label the first 5000 rows as class 1 and the remaining rows as class 2. Use SVM and Neural Network to classify the data and report 10-fold cross-validated accuracy. Describe the parameters of your classifiers.

b) Label the rows [1:500,1001:1500,2001:2500,3001:3500,4001:4500,5001:5500,6001:6500,7001:7500,8001:8500,9001:9500]
as class 1 and the remaining rows as class 2. Use SVM and Neural Network to classify the data and report 10-fold cross-validated accuracy. Describe the parameters of your classifiers.
